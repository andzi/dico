   INFORMATION ABOUT THE DICTIONARY TITLE: English - Hindi Dictionary :
   Version-2.0 (with example sentences) DEVELOPERS: Language Technologies
   Research Centre, IIIT, Hyderabad, India. FUNDED BY: Satyam Computers
   URL: http://www.iiit.net/resources/overview.htm LICENCE: General Public
   Licence REMARKS: Developed through Voluntary Collaborative Effort.
   Quality not uniform. The English-Hindi Dictionary Version 2.0 contains
   approximately 25,000 English headwords. For every English headword it's
   possible Hindi meanings are given. For each meaning an example sentence
   is given to show the context in which the meaning occurs. In most cases
   the example sentences are in English. But there are cases where the
   example sentences are given in Hindi. This dictionary has been
   developed through a Voluntary Collaborative effort. Since the
   contributors of the data base are from varying backgrounds, including
   school children, the quality of the content is not uniform. There is no
   claim of excellence in quality. In fact, it needs to be further
   improved. The idea here is to provide a basic electronic lexical data
   base for English- Hindi which the users can further improve and develop
   according to their needs. This dictionary is being released under the
   General Public Licence (GPL). This licence allows you to make copies of
   the dictionary and distribute freely. It also allows you to build on
   top of this dictionary or a part thereof and redistribute the resulting
   work. However, essentially, there is only one condition: the resulting
   work must also be licenced under GPL (See a copy of GPL Licence for
   more details). An effort has been made to make the entries as complete
   as possible. However, a number of entries need elaboration.There are
   entries which have their Hindi equivalents but no example sentences.
   There are entries where the English headword is given with its
   grammatical category but does not have either the Hindi meaning or an
   example sentence. There are also entries which have the english
   headword, its grammatical category, an example to show its semantic
   content, however, it does not have the Hindi equivalent for the same.
   These gaps have yet to be filled. Work will continue to complete the
   missing pieces of information. Users are invited to join the team of
   volunteers engaged in adding to and refining the dictionary. At the
   very least they can point out the errors to us. See the website for: 1.
   Dictionary Format and Special Symbols Used. 2. Abbreviations of the
   Grammatical Category Names. 3. Data Sources. 4. Contributors. 5. You
   can contribute too!!! Your Valuable Feedback can be sent to
